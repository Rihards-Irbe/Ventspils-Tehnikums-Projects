# Ventspils Tehnikums School Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I've developed while studying at **Ventspils Tehnikums**.

Each project is organized by date and topic, covering various technologies and subjects including Java, JavaFX, Laravel, basic frontend, and database-related work. The goal of this repository is to showcase the diversity of skills and knowledge I've gained throughout my studies.

## ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer

These are **not all** the projects I completed during my time at Ventspils Tehnikums. Due to access restrictions placed after graduation, many of my past projects are no longer available to me.
## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

Projects are named using the following format: ```date```_```programming language/s```-```project name```.

Each project includes its own `README.md` with a full explanation, features, and setup instructions. Some also include **images** and my exam project has a **demonstration video**.
