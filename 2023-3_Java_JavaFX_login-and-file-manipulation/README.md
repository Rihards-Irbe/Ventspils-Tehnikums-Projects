## Overview
This project is a Java application that uses JavaFX to create a graphical user interface. This was an introduction to JavaFX. It features a basic password input field, that when inputting a correct password switches to registration scene, which lets you enter multiple fields. When filling these fields and saving, the data inside these fields is saved into a data/info.txt file and is ready to be accessed in the next run. By clicking "Check" these values will be displayed.

## Features
- GUI built with JavaFX and Scene Builder (FXML-based).
- Comprehensive and organized file structure.
- Login functionality.
- Ability to save multiple input types data into a seperate file.
- Uses Java class setters and getters to handle and manipulate field values.
