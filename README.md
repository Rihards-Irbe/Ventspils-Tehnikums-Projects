# 🏫Ventspils Tehnikums School Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I've developed while studying at **Ventspils Tehnikums**.

Each project is organized by date and topic, covering various technologies and subjects including Java, JavaFX, Laravel, basic frontend, and database-related work. The goal of this repository is to showcase the diversity of skills and knowledge I've gained throughout my studies.

## 🌟 Notable Projects

Here are some highlights from the repository:

- **2024-6_Laravel_Exam-Project** – A Laravel based music streaming website developed as part of my exam project. This project contributed to earning a diploma for excellence in programming.
- **2023-9_Java_JavaFX_sorting-algorithm-measuring** -  A Java application using JavaFX to visualize and measure the performance of various sorting algorithms.

## 📂 Project Structure

Projects are named using the following format: ```date```_```programming language/s```-```project name```.
